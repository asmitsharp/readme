# Video Script: Project Overview and Demonstration

**[INTRO]**

[Scene: Host in front of the camera, with a computer screen showing the project repository.]

**Host:**  
"Hello everyone! Welcome to this video where we will explore a web application built using Node.js and Express. This application is designed for managing items and user authentication. Today, I’ll walk you through the key features of the project, demonstrate how it works, and explain the different parts of the codebase. Let’s get started!"

---

**[SECTION 1: Project Overview]**

[Scene: Screen share showing the project structure.]

**Host:**  
"Here’s the structure of our project. At the top level, we have several folders including `routes`, `controllers`, `models`, and `utils`. Each of these folders serves a specific purpose in our application."

---

**[SECTION 2: Features]**

[Scene: Host explaining features with bullet points on the screen.]

**Host:**  
"This application has several key features:

- **User Authentication:** Users can register and log in to the application. Upon successful login, they receive a JSON Web Token for secure access.
- **Item Management:** Users can create, retrieve, update, delete, and search for items.
- **Middleware:** We have authentication middleware to protect certain routes that require user authentication.
- **Database Integration:** The application uses PostgreSQL for data storage and retrieval, ensuring data persistence."

---

**[SECTION 3: Code Walkthrough]**

[Scene: Screen share showing the `routes/item.ts` file.]

**Host:**  
"Let’s dive into the code. We’ll start with the `item.ts` file located in the `routes` folder. This file defines the routes for item-related operations."

```typescript
import express from "express"; // Import the Express framework
import {
  createItem, // Import the function to create a new item
  getItem, // Import the function to retrieve an item by ID
  updateItem, // Import the function to update an existing item
  deleteItem, // Import the function to delete an item by ID
  getItems, // Import the function to retrieve a list of items
  searchItems, // Import the function to search for items
} from "../controllers/itemController"; // Import item controller functions
import { authenticate } from "../middleware/auth"; // Import authentication middleware

const router = express.Router(); // Create a new router instance

// Define routes for item-related operations
router.post("/", authenticate, createItem); // Route to create a new item (requires authentication)
router.get("/:id", getItem); // Route to retrieve an item by ID
router.put("/:id", authenticate, updateItem); // Route to update an existing item (requires authentication)
router.delete("/:id", authenticate, deleteItem); // Route to delete an item by ID (requires authentication)
router.get("/", getItems); // Route to retrieve a list of items
router.get("/search", searchItems); // Route to search for items

export default router; // Export the router for use in other modules
```

**Host:**  
"In this file, we import the necessary functions from the item controller and set up our routes. Each route corresponds to a specific operation, such as creating or retrieving items. We also use the `authenticate` middleware to protect certain routes."

---

[Scene: Screen share showing the `routes/auth.ts` file.]

**Host:**  
"Next, let’s look at the `auth.ts` file, which handles user authentication."

```typescript
import express from "express"; // Import the Express framework
import { register, login } from "../controllers/authController"; // Import authentication controller functions

const router = express.Router(); // Create a new router instance

// Define routes for authentication operations
router.post("/register", register); // Route to register a new user
router.post("/login", login); // Route to log in an existing user

export default router; // Export the router for use in other modules
```

**Host:**  
"This file defines the routes for user registration and login. When a user registers or logs in, the corresponding controller functions handle the logic."

---

[Scene: Screen share showing the `controllers/itemController.ts` file.]

**Host:**  
"Now, let’s check out the `itemController.ts` file, which contains the logic for handling item-related operations."

```typescript
import pool from "../utils/db"; // Import the database connection pool
import logger from "../utils/logger"; // Import logger for logging application events

export const createItem = async (req, res) => {
  // Logic to create a new item
};

export const getItem = async (req, res) => {
  // Logic to retrieve an item by ID
};

// Additional functions for updating, deleting, and searching items...
```

**Host:**  
"In this controller, we define functions for creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting items. Each function interacts with the database to perform the necessary operations."

---

[Scene: Screen share showing the `models/item.ts` file.]

**Host:**  
"Next, we have the `item.ts` model, which defines the structure of our item data and interacts with the database."

```typescript
import pool from "../utils/db"; // Import the database connection pool

export class ItemModel {
  static async create(name, description, price) {
    // Logic to insert a new item into the database
  }

  static async findById(id) {
    // Logic to find an item by ID
  }

  // Additional methods for updating, deleting, and searching items...
}
```

**Host:**  
"This model contains methods for interacting with the database, such as creating a new item or finding an item by its ID."

---

[Scene: Host back in front of the camera.]

**Host:**  
"Finally, let’s talk about how to run this project locally."

---

**[SECTION 4: Running the Project]**

[Scene: Host explaining the steps with a screen share showing the terminal.]

**Host:**  
"To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository from GitHub.
2. Install the necessary dependencies using `npm install`.
3. Set up your PostgreSQL database and update the `.env` file with your database connection details.
4. Start the application with `npm start`.
5. You can access the API at `http://localhost:3000`."
