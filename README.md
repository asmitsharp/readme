# Video Script: API and GraphQL Walk-Through

**[INTRO]**

[Scene: Host in front of the camera, with a computer screen showing the project repository.]

**Host:**  
"Hello everyone! Welcome to this video where we will explore our Node.js and Express API, along with the GraphQL functionality integrated into the application. Today, I’ll walk you through the functionality of the API, explain the code structure, and demonstrate how to interact with both REST and GraphQL endpoints. Let’s dive in!"

---

**[SECTION 1: Project Overview]**

[Scene: Screen share showing the project structure.]

**Host:**  
"Here’s the structure of our project. We have several key folders:

- **routes**: Contains the route definitions for our API.
- **controllers**: Contains the logic for handling requests and responses.
- **models**: Defines the data structure and interacts with the database.
- **utils**: Contains utility functions and classes, such as logging and caching.
- **graphql**: Contains the GraphQL schema and resolvers.

Let’s start by looking at the `routes` folder."

---

**[SECTION 2: Routes Overview]**

[Scene: Screen share showing the `src/routes/item.ts` file.]

**Host:**  
"First, we have the `item.ts` file in the `routes` folder. This file defines the routes for item-related operations."

```typescript
import express from "express"; // Import the Express framework
import {
  createItem, // Import the function to create a new item
  getItem, // Import the function to retrieve an item by ID
  updateItem, // Import the function to update an existing item
  deleteItem, // Import the function to delete an item by ID
  getItems, // Import the function to retrieve a list of items
  searchItems, // Import the function to search for items
} from "../controllers/itemController"; // Import item controller functions
import { authenticate } from "../middleware/auth"; // Import authentication middleware

const router = express.Router(); // Create a new router instance

// Define routes for item-related operations
router.post("/", authenticate, createItem); // Route to create a new item (requires authentication)
router.get("/:id", getItem); // Route to retrieve an item by ID
router.put("/:id", authenticate, updateItem); // Route to update an existing item (requires authentication)
router.delete("/:id", authenticate, deleteItem); // Route to delete an item by ID (requires authentication)
router.get("/", getItems); // Route to retrieve a list of items
router.get("/search", searchItems); // Route to search for items

export default router; // Export the router for use in other modules
```

**Host:**  
"In this file, we import the necessary functions from the item controller and set up our routes. Each route corresponds to a specific operation, such as creating or retrieving items. We also use the `authenticate` middleware to protect certain routes that require user authentication."

---

[Scene: Screen share showing the `src/routes/auth.ts` file.]

**Host:**  
"Next, let’s look at the `auth.ts` file, which handles user authentication."

```typescript
import express from "express"; // Import the Express framework
import { register, login } from "../controllers/authController"; // Import authentication controller functions

const router = express.Router(); // Create a new router instance

// Define routes for authentication operations
router.post("/register", register); // Route to register a new user
router.post("/login", login); // Route to log in an existing user

export default router; // Export the router for use in other modules
```

**Host:**  
"This file defines the routes for user registration and login. When a user registers or logs in, the corresponding controller functions handle the logic."

---

**[SECTION 3: Controllers Overview]**

[Scene: Screen share showing the `src/controllers/itemController.ts` file.]

**Host:**  
"Now, let’s check out the `itemController.ts` file, which contains the logic for handling item-related operations."

```typescript
import pool from "../utils/db"; // Import the database connection pool
import logger from "../utils/logger"; // Import logger for logging application events

export const createItem = async (req, res) => {
  // Logic to create a new item
};

export const getItem = async (req, res) => {
  // Logic to retrieve an item by ID
};

// Additional functions for updating, deleting, and searching items...
```

**Host:**  
"In this controller, we define functions for creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting items. Each function interacts with the database to perform the necessary operations. For example, the `createItem` function will take the item details from the request body and insert them into the database."

---

[Scene: Screen share showing the `src/controllers/authController.ts` file.]

**Host:**  
"Next, let’s look at the `authController.ts` file, which handles user authentication."

```typescript
import { Request, Response } from "express"; // Import Request and Response types from Express
import jwt from "jsonwebtoken"; // Import jsonwebtoken for creating JWT tokens
import { UserModel } from "../models/user"; // Import UserModel for user-related database operations
import logger from "../utils/logger"; // Import logger for logging application events

export const register = async (req: Request, res: Response) => {
  // Logic to handle user registration
};

export const login = async (req: Request, res: Response): Promise<void> => {
  // Logic to handle user login
};
```

**Host:**  
"This controller contains the logic for user registration and login. When a user registers, we create a new user in the database and generate a JWT token for authentication."

---

**[SECTION 4: Models Overview]**

[Scene: Screen share showing the `src/models/item.ts` file.]

**Host:**  
"Now, let’s check out the `item.ts` model, which defines the structure of our item data and interacts with the database."

```typescript
import pool from "../utils/db"; // Import the database connection pool

export class ItemModel {
  static async create(name, description, price) {
    // Logic to insert a new item into the database
  }

  static async findById(id) {
    // Logic to find an item by ID
  }

  // Additional methods for updating, deleting, and searching items...
}
```

**Host:**  
"This model contains methods for interacting with the database, such as creating a new item or finding an item by its ID."

---

[Scene: Screen share showing the `src/models/user.ts` file.]

**Host:**  
"Next, we have the `user.ts` model, which handles user data."

```typescript
import pool from "../utils/db"; // Import database connection pool
import logger from "../utils/logger"; // Import logger for logging application events
import bcrypt from "bcrypt"; // Import bcrypt for password hashing

export class UserModel {
  static async create(username, email, password) {
    // Logic to create a new user
  }

  static async findByEmail(email) {
    // Logic to find a user by email
  }

  // Additional methods for updating and deleting users...
}
```

**Host:**  
"This model defines methods for creating users, finding users by email, and validating passwords. It ensures that user data is securely managed."

---

**[SECTION 5: GraphQL Overview]**

[Scene: Screen share showing the `src/graphql/schema.ts` file.]

**Host:**  
"Now, let’s discuss the GraphQL part of our application. In the `graphql` folder, we define our GraphQL schema and resolvers."

```typescript
import { gql } from "apollo-server-express"; // Import gql for defining GraphQL schema

// Define the GraphQL schema using Schema Definition Language (SDL)
export const typeDefs = gql`
  type User {
    id: ID! // Unique identifier for the user
    username: String! // Username of the user
    email: String! // Email of the user
  }

  type Item {
    id: ID! // Unique identifier for the item
    name: String! // Name of the item
    description: String! // Description of the item
    price: Float! // Price of the item
  }

  type Query {
    getItem(id: ID!): Item // Query to get an item by ID
    getItems: [Item!]! // Query to get a list of items
  }

  type Mutation {
    createItem(name: String!, description: String!, price: Float!): Item! // Mutation to create a new item
  }
`;
```

**Host:**  
"In this schema, we define the types for `User` and `Item`, along with queries and mutations. For example, we have a query to get an item by its ID and a mutation to create a new item."

---

[Scene: Screen share showing the `src/graphql/resolvers.ts` file.]

**Host:**  
"Next, let’s look at the resolvers, which contain the logic for handling GraphQL queries and mutations."

```typescript
import { ItemModel } from "../models/item"; // Import ItemModel for database operations

export const resolvers = {
  Query: {
    getItem: async (_, { id }) => {
      // Logic to retrieve an item by ID
      return ItemModel.findById(id);
    },
    getItems: async () => {
      // Logic to retrieve a list of items
      return ItemModel.findAll();
    },
  },
  Mutation: {
    createItem: async (_, { name, description, price }) => {
      // Logic to create a new item
      return ItemModel.create(name, description, price);
    },
  },
};
```

**Host:**  
"The resolvers define how to fetch the data for each query and mutation. For instance, the `getItem` resolver retrieves an item by its ID, while the `createItem` resolver creates a new item in the database."

---

**[SECTION 6: Running the Project]**

[Scene: Host explaining the steps with a screen share showing the terminal.]

**Host:**  
"To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository from GitHub.
2. Install the necessary dependencies using `npm install`.
3. Set up your PostgreSQL database and update the `.env` file with your database connection details.
4. Start the application with `npm start`.
5. You can access the REST API at `http://localhost:3000` and the GraphQL endpoint at `http://localhost:3000/graphql`."

---

**[SECTION 7: API Demonstration]**

[Scene: Host demonstrating API functionality using Postman or a similar tool.]

**Host:**  
"Now, let’s demonstrate how to interact with the API using Postman. 

- First, I’ll register a new user by sending a POST request to `/auth/register` with the required details.
- Next, I’ll log in the user to receive a JWT token.
- After that, I’ll create a new item by sending a POST request to `/items` with the item details, using the token for authentication.
- Finally, I’ll retrieve the list of items and search for a specific item."

[Scene: Show the requests and responses in Postman.]

---

**[SECTION 8: GraphQL Demonstration]**

[Scene: Host demonstrating GraphQL functionality using a tool like GraphiQL or Postman.]

**Host:**  
"Now, let’s explore the GraphQL functionality. 

- I’ll open the GraphQL playground and run a query to get a list of items.
- Next, I’ll create a new item using a mutation and check if it was added successfully."

[Scene: Show the GraphQL queries and mutations being executed.]
